# ReactJS exercice for new hirings

The goal here is to complete a very simple CMS powered by ReactJS.

## Context

This CMS works on a very simple concept:
  - the left side is dedicated to editing the content only.
  - the right side displays a preview of the content.

There is one simple rule: once the content has been changed on the left side, the right side is automatically updated.

Here is a video about how it should look like:

[Video.mp4](./output.mp4)

For now, the CMS doesn't offer a way to persist the content and let's say we're okay with that. So no server side code to write!

## Exercices

Do as many items as you can in one hour.

1. Fork the project

2. Launch the app locally

3. Fix the warnings

4. Build the text inputs described in `src/localData.js` in the left pane of the editor. Feel free to use the Reactstrap components here (http://reactstrap.github.io/components/form/).

5. Update the preview mode when an input has been modified

6. Build the select input named backgroundColor. The options of this input represents the background colors.

7. Commit your work and send us a PR (Pull Request)

## Discussion / Questions

- describe the solution you implemented
- what would have been a better solution?
- technical questions:
  - When would you use a Class Component over a Functional Component?
  - What is the difference between a controlled component and an uncontrolled component?
  - In which lifecycle event do you make AJAX requests?


**Good luck!**
